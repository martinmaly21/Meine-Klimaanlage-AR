### Enhancing Air Conditioning Installations with Augmented Reality

Meine Klimaanlage AR is an innovative app developed for a German air conditioning company to revolutionize the way potential clients visualize air conditioning units in their homes before making a purchase. This app leverages augmented reality to provide a realistic preview of the unit's placement, ensuring clients are fully satisfied with their choice.

The app also assists workers by accurately determining the precise length of wiring required for the installation. Additionally, Meine Klimaanlage AR compiles all the relevant information and sends it back to the company, improving organization and efficiency in the installation process.
